Initial release of the extension

- Downloading of entries
- Uploading entries onsave
- Update set management, like displaying the currently selected update set and setting a new default one that would be used in subsequent calls in your session
- To choose a different update set, just click on the right bottom on the update set name and you should be presented with a list of other update sets
- We support basic authentication only but if there will be popular demand on other types, we are able to do it
- We support scopes, that means your entries will be saved in the specific scope they belong to
- No support for creating new entries for now
- We support searching for tables and their entries inside of vscode. After picking your entry, the entry gets downloaded locally
