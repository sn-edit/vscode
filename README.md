# sn-edit

Download the extension [SN-EDIT - Servicenow Editor Engine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SNEDIT.sn-edit)

The extension provides a bridge between sn-edit and the Visual Studio Code UI. We've created a few simple commands that are useful for daily development and could be used while development. 

**For the extension to work correctly:**
- Install **NodeJS** from the [Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (At least the LTS version or anything newer)
- Download the [sn-edit](https://docs.sn-edit.com/#/getting-started/README) application, for the instructions, please refer to our [docs site](https://docs.sn-edit.com/#/getting-started/README).

After installing sn-edit, please use the [configuration generator](https://conf.sn-edit.com/) to download your config file.

The capabilities include:
- Downloading of entries
- Uploading entries onsave
- Update set management, like displaying the currently selected update set and setting a new default one that would be used in subsequent calls in your session
- To choose a different update set, just click on the right bottom on the update set name and you should be presented with a list of other update sets
- We support basic authentication only but if there will be popular demand on other types, we are able to do it
- We support scopes, that means your entries will be saved in the specific scope they belong to
- No support for creating new entries for now
- We support searching for tables and their entries inside of vscode. After picking your entry, the entry gets downloaded locally
- Support to run background scripts from local js files (Not supported by the extension yet, but supported by sn-edit)
